   <h1>GENERATING AKAN NAMES</h1>
   <h3>The Akans are a meta-ethnicity who primarily live in Ghana and Ivory Coast
        with a population of around 20 million people. As a meta-ethnicity they
         share a lot of common traits, but there are various sub-groups related
          mostly to language and some cultural differences.
           Many Akan people were taken as slaves and brought to America,
            as a result Akan influences can be found in American territories
             as well, most noticeably in the Caribbean,of which Jamaica has
              the strongest influences in terms of names.
    The Akans have a fairly unique naming system, which is based on the
     day a child is born, and on the gender of the child.
      So a boy born on a Monday would be named Kwadwo or Koho,
       and a girl would be called Adwoa. Each day has one or more variants,
        but there's usually not much to choose from.
    On top of that the Akans may also have a middle name which is based
     on a quality, trait, family member or something else.
      There are some names in this generator which are part of this system,
       most noticeably the names related to where and/or how the birth took place.
    The Akans also have family names which are often taken from the father's
     side, but the mother's side may also be taken.
      This often happens when the mother only has sisters,
       and the name would thus be lost if nobody takes her name.</h3>
